# 3DPrinting_Calibration_Models

A set of models that can be used to test out a new nozzle, or filament to narrow down what settings to need for a slicer.

The goal is to have them all be OpenSCAD models that can be parameterized.

TODO: I also want to add some Simplify3D "Factory Files" which are collections of STLs, with modification, and Processes to get a single print bed worth of test models to test out any new setup.
